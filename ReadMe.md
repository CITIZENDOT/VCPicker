### *for Codeforces*

![](images/logo.png)

### Intro
---

Sometimes we compete with our friends by organazing Virtual Contests, Right?

But we need a past contest in which all of our friends never attempted any question. If the number of friends is small(Like 2 or 3), then It's okay, to select the contest manually.

But If friends are more? We can't ask all of them whether they have attempted a question from a particular contest.

This code does the exact work mentioned above.

*__It selects the contest in which all of our friends had never attempted a question.__*
